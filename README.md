## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project analyzes player data from the **2024-25 Premier League** season.  
The goal is to explore insights such as:
- Which players scored the most goals and provided the most assists.
- Distribution of players' ages across all teams.
- Average age per team and which squads are the youngest/oldest.
- Total goals per team.
- Relationship between players' ages and number of goals (Do younger players score more?).

The project includes **data cleaning**, **grouping & aggregation**, and **visualizations** using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
